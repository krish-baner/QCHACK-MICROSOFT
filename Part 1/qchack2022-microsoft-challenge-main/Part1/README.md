# Part 1: Warmup Tasks

Part 1 of the challenge consists of three independent warmup tasks, each presented in a separate Notebook (Q# or Python). You can use Azure Quantum hosted Notebooks as the environment to work on these tasks, without needing to install any QDK components locally.

## Task 1. Implementing a quantum oracle (Q#) – 1 point

In this task, you should implement your solution in Q# in the first cell of [the notebook](./Task1_QuantumOracleQsharp.ipynb). The rest of the cells contain the testing harness used to verify your solution. You can use them when working on your solution, but any modifications to them will not be evaluated.

To submit this task, update [the notebook for the task](./Task1_QuantumOracleQsharp.ipynb) with your solution code in the first cell. 

## Task 2. Submitting Azure Quantum jobs from Q# Jupyter Notebooks (Q# + IonQ simulator) – 1 point

In this task, you are already given all the code you’ll need; you only need to set up the Azure Quantum connection information and use it to run this code on the IonQ simulator target.

To submit this task, update [the notebook for the task](./Task2_DeutschAlgorithmQsharpIonQ.ipynb) with the saved results of code cells execution.

## Task 3. Submitting Azure Quantum jobs from Python Jupyter Notebooks (Qiskit + Quantinuum emulator) – 1 point

In this task, you are already given all the code you’ll need; you only need to set up the Azure Quantum connection information and use it to run this code on the Quantinuum emulator target.

To submit this task, update [the notebook for the task](./Task3_QrngQiskitQuantinuum.ipynb) with the saved results of code cells execution.
